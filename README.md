## Hello There

i'm Yann Perrin, a french [web developper](/work/README.md) and long time [boardgame enthusiast](/hobby/boardgames/index.md).

I'm also :
- [a freelance boardgame designer](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/156056/yann-perrin)
- a movie lover
- a series lover
- a book and graphic novels reader
- a casual videogame player
- a tinkerer
- a geek

Also, while i do read and write english quite often, i'm more at ease in my native language, so most of the links here will lead to some content in french.
